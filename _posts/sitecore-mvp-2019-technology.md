Yep, it happened! I am happy to announce that I have been awarded a Sitecore Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Award for 2019 in Technology. The Sitecore MVP Award is awarded to the most active Sitecore community members from around the world who provide valuable online and offline expertise that enriches the community experience and makes a difference. I am honored to be part of the Sitecore community as we push the boundaries with Sitecore.
